# ng-di

Spectacular Angular Dependency Injection isolated as a library. Working in Browser and Node enviroments

**Current Version 0.1.0**

Status: STABLE API - UNSTABLE Code sources location - All Test passing


## Getting Started
### On the server
Install the module with: `npm install ng-di`

```javascript
var di = require('ng-di');
di.module(...);
```

### In the browser
Download the [production version](dist/ng-di.min.js) or the [development version](dist/ng-di.js).

You can also download a [ZIP version](dist/ng-di.zip) with both flavours and the mocks helper.

In your web page:

```html
<script src="dist/ng-di.min.js"></script>
<script>
di.module(...)
</script>
```


## Documentation
This library simply isolates [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org)
[dependency injection](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di), exposing its
[module API](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module) as part of it.

All the DOM management has been removed, and makes this library the ideal artifact for using
 Javascript Dependency Injection in javascript only apps, libraries...
 
It's available as `di` instead of `angular`

The public API, considered stable, is(*):
 * [module](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/angular.Module). Exposed as `di.module`
 * [injector](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/AUTO.$injector). Exposed as `di.injector`

(*)As this library is framework agnostic, the AngularJS concepts and module API methods `module.directive` 
and `module.controller` are NOT available inside the Module API

Other non documented utility methods here are for private usage, and can be removed 

Please, refer to Angular Documentation on this topics, as ng-di exposes them as-is.

## Examples
You can go to the [examples](examples) folder to see how to use in [node](examples/node) and [browser](examples/browser)

## Testing
The tests provided have been written in jasmine, and are executed in browser with Karma Runner and in Node with jasmine-node

For your convenience on writting testable code using ng-di, as well as in angular, two utility functions are exposed
```javascript
mock.module(...);
mock.inject(...);
```

You can read through [code documentation](mock/index.js#L65) or learn by watching [examples](#examples)

### node
```javascript
var mock = require('ng-di/mock'),
//mock.module and mock.inject are available
```

### Browser
Include the [mock helper][mock] in your test flow.

[mock]: https://raw.github.com/jmendiara/ng-di/master/dist/mock.js

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="mock.js"></script>
<!-- mock.module and mock.inject are available -->
```

## Development

**Install all dependencies**

```shell
npm install 
```

ng-di uses grunt 0.4.x for building the browser version and for testing. You will need to have installed grunt-cli as global

**Pass all test in browser and node.**

Relies on Karma and assumes a Chrome browser installed on your machine
```shell
grunt test
```

**Build the browser version**

Creates all browser compatible code on /dist directory
```shell
grunt build
```

**Test and build**

```shell
grunt 
```


## Aim of this project
The goal behind this project is closing the gap between the browser and node enviroments for developing testable libraries
and applications that could be used in both enviroments.  

Just provide different implementions for those environment dependant code (Browser XMLHttpRequest vs. Node http) and reuse 
all the application code

ng-di isolates you from the dependency injection in environments, but you will have to deal with the CommonsJS/AMD/no-module 
problem by yourself. Ideas are always welcome!

## Release History

ng-di uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)

### v0.1.0 - UNSTABLE
* Completely rewrite internals using commonsJS module.
* Adding mocks for both environments

#### BREAKING CHANGES
* $utils is not exposed anymore. 
* Module 'di' is not registered by default
* Removed lots of utility functions from being accesible. See [utils](lib/utils.js) for details.
* Requiring in node does not need to recall `di`. Use: `var di = require('ng-di');`

### v0.0.4 
* Adding more utilities functions to the code
 
### v0.0.3 
* Adding more utilities functions to the code

### v0.0.2 
* new service in module `di` exposing `$utils` functions

### v0.0.1 
 * First approach
